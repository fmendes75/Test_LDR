Test_LDR
========

This is a test code to learn the beavour of a LDR sensor. The code need
to be cleaned, but for now do the job.
The project have two programs:
1- Arduino that read LDR, calculate derivative and send data by serial
port.
2- Processing program that show data(light and derivative) on a graph.
